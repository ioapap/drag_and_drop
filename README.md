# Project Manager - TypeScript Practice Demo 🚀

**Project Manager** is a demo project, a culmination of the various concepts and tools learned throughout the TypeScript course.

## App Overview 🌐

The **Project Manager** is a simple yet effective tool designed to help manage projects. Here's what it offers:

- **Manage Projects**: At its core, the application lets you manage multiple projects. Think of a project as a goal you aim to achieve.
- **Two Lists**: The projects are categorized into two lists:
  - **Active List**: This list contains all ongoing projects.
  - **Finished List**: Here, you'll find all the projects you've completed.
- **Drag & Drop Functionality**: An intuitive drag and drop feature lets you move projects between the active and finished lists seamlessly.

While the application itself is a simple demo tool for project management, the real treasure lies in its codebase. It's a hands-on demonstration and practice of the numerous TypeScript features learned throughout the course.

## Bundling with Webpack 🎒

The **Project Manager** is bundled using **Webpack**:

- It bundles files into a `bundle.js`, enhancing performance by reducing HTTP requests.
- A dual webpack configuration is present:
  - **Development Setup**: Simplifies debugging and offers more descriptive error messages.
  - **Production Configuration**: Optimizes the code for deployment.
